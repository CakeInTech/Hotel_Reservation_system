## Getting Started

To get started with development, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the live development version.

You can start editing the project by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The application will automatically update as you save changes.

## API Routes

- API routes are accessible at [http://localhost:3000/api/\*](http://localhost:3000/api/*). You can edit or add new routes under the `app/api` directory.

## Configuration and Customization

- **Font Optimization**: This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically load and optimize Google Fonts (like Inter), ensuring a clean and professional design.
- **Images**: We leverage Next.js’ built-in image optimization with support for external sources like Unsplash.
